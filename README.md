# GitHub Api pet project
## Javascript and Typescript

This project fetches repositories from the Github Api and performs some transformations to them. 

Run `yarn install` to create the node modules.
Run `yarn test` to run the tests of the module app.js

Typescript is under `src/`.

TO DO:

- I added some test for the new functionalities, I should change the previous test to the typescript functions equivalent.
- Migrate tests to Typescript.
- Add automatic pagination to gather all the repositories currently it fetches only 30 on js and 100 on ts.
